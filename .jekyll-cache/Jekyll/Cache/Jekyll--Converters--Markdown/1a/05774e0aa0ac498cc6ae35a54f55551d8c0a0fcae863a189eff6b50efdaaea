<p>&lt;/br&gt;
We are extremely excited to being joining the Scripps marine biology program! Our lab specializes in multi-omic analyses to understand coral reef dynamics and we are extatic to both continue our collaborations at SIO and also form many new ones.
 &lt;/br&gt;
 &lt;/br&gt;
We cannot wait to meet our new colleagues!
