  <li>The effects of nutrient pollution on coral reef ecosystems are multifaceted. Numerous experiments have sought to identify the physiological effects of nutrient enrichment on reef‚Äêbuilding corals, but the results have been variable and sensitive to choices of nutrient quantity, chemical composition and exposure duration.</li>
  <li>To test the effects of chronic, ecologically relevant nutrient enrichment on coral growth and photophysiology, we conducted a 5‚Äêweek continuous dosing experiment on two Hawaiian coral species, Porites compressa and Pocillopora acuta. We acclimated coral fragments to five nutrient concentrations (0.1‚Äì7 ¬µM urn:x-wiley:02698463:media:fec13780:fec13780-math-0001 and 0.06‚Äì2.24 ¬µM urn:x-wiley:02698463:media:fec13780:fec13780-math-0002) with constant stoichiometry 2.5:1 nitrate to phosphate) bracketing in situ observations from reefs throughout the Pacific.</li>
  <li>Nutrient enrichment linearly increased photophysiological performance of both species within 3 weeks. The effect of nutrients on P. acuta photochemical efficiency increased through time while a consistent response in P. compressa indicated acclimation to elevated nutrients within 5 weeks. Endosymbiont densities and total chlorophyll concentrations also increased proportionally with nutrient enrichment in P. acuta, but not in P. compressa, revealing contrasting patterns of host‚Äìsymbiont acclimatization.</li>
  <li>The two species also exhibited contrasting effects of nutrient enrichment on skeletal growth. Calcification was enhanced at low nutrient enrichment (1 ¬µM urn:x-wiley:02698463:media:fec13780:fec13780-math-0003) in P. acuta, but comparable to the control at higher concentrations, whereas calcification was reduced in P. compressa (30%‚Äì35%) above 3 ¬µM urn:x-wiley:02698463:media:fec13780:fec13780-math-0004.</li>
  <li>Stable isotope analysis revealed species‚Äêspecific nitrogen uptake dynamics in the coral‚Äìalgal symbiosis. The endosymbionts of P. acuta exhibited increased nitrogen uptake (decreased Œ¥15N) and incorporation (19%‚Äì31% decrease in C:N ratios) across treatments. In contrast, P. compressa endosymbionts maintained constant Œ¥15N values and low levels of nitrogen incorporation (9%‚Äì11% decrease in C:N ratios). The inability of P. acuta to regulate endosymbiont nutrient uptake may indicate an emerging destabilization in the coral‚Äìalgal symbiosis under nutrient enrichment that could compromise resistance to additional environmental stressors.</li>
  <li>Our results highlight species‚Äêspecific differences in the coral‚Äìalgal symbiosis, which influence responses to chronic nutrient enrichment. These findings showcase how symbioses can vary among closely related taxa and underscore the importance of considering how life‚Äêhistory traits modify species response to environmental change.</li>
