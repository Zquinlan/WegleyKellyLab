# The Wegley Kelly lab is joining SIO!
</br>
We are extremely excited to being joining the Scripps marine biology program! Our lab specializes in multi-omic analyses to understand coral reef dynamics and we are extatic to both continue our collaborations at SIO and also form many new ones.

We cannot wait to meet our new colleagues!
